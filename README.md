#SHEalth
## Inspiration
We were tasked with making healthcare more accessible in countries such as Bangladesh. We needed to create an app that could be used with little to no internet, that offered simple communication, and that put the user's health at the front. Something that could make the person who used the app feel supported, by their local health care worker or even someone in their community in the same situation.
>The result became one part voice call/SMS bot, one part portal to the status of people in the community, also known as two parts SHEalth.

## What it does
After going through a simple "survey", the user is matched with someone of their community based on the symptoms they have in common. The symptoms they have are then stored into a database for the viewing of the local health care worker. They have access to all the data pertaining to the symptoms, thus helping in identifying trends among the community.

## How we built it
With a team of six, separating the job was a piece of cake. Getting to an agreement on the idea and the different part of it to work together was another thing. We used a language everyone was familiar with, JavaScript, implemented Twilio's API, made collections in MongoDB, and hosted the whole on Heroku.

## Challenges we ran into
Working with Twilio was a rollercoaster ride and, for some, JavaScript coding was accompanied by W3School and TutorialsPoint documentation. The database, however, was scrapped twice (originally in PHP, then in MySQL) <del>because we were forced to used</del> before we finally settled on using MongoDB.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
<del>Not sleeping. Sleep is for the weak.</del>

## What we learned
Teamwork makes the most tedious work less of a work... less... workier.... <del>Cut me some slack; it's 3:44 AM here</del>

## What's next for SHEalth
More features to come :)
